# satellite-attitude-control-comparison
An aerospace  engineering project comparing 4 controllers- PID+Relay, PID+Relay +Deadzone, DDPG and DQN for a single-axis satellite attitude control across 5 test

cases : Baseline tracking, Large angle recovery, Steady disturbance, Inertia Variation and Detumbling

This Final Year Project (BEng Hons Aerospace Engineering, University of Hertfordshire) implements and benchmarks four attitude control approaches:

PID + Relay (classical)

PID + Relay + Deadzone (classical)

DDPG (continuous deep reinforcement learning)

DQN (discrete deep reinforcement learning)

All controllers target a satellite plant model with moment of inertia J = 11.4 kg·m² (Khosravi & Sarhadi, 2016).

Repository Structure:

The repository is organized by controller type, with each controller containing all necessary files (Simulink models, MATLAB code, and results plots).

Controllers/Classical/

PID_Relay/ — Classical PID + Relay: sim_relay.slx, relay_sim.m, plots/

PID_Deadzone_Relay/ — Classical PID + Deadzone + Relay: sim_relay_deadzone.slx, relay_deadzone_sim.m, plots/

Controllers/Reinforcement_Learning/

DDPG/ — Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient agent

Double_integrator_model3.m (plant model), resetfuncJS2model3.m, stepfunctionJS23.m, main_script_DDPG.m (training), rlsimulate.m (testing), plots/

DQN/ — Deep Q-Network agent

Installation & Setup

Requirements:

MATLAB R2022b or later

Simulink

Steps to run:

For classical controllers, open both Simulink and the MATLAB code file and run the code with all the paramter inputs for the results

For DRL controllers, open all the four files (training script, reset function, step function and testing funcrion). Ensure they are contained in the same folder.

If the agent is to be retrained, update the training parameters with your choice of values and run the training script file.

If there is no re-training required, simply run the testing script file.

Test Case Performance:

Nominal step (θ₀=0.5 rad): All controllers succeed

Large angle (θ₀=5 rad): PID variants succeed; DDPG may diverge (Case 2 failure)

Disturbance (0.5 N·m): Classical + RL handled; Ki helps steady-state rejection

Inertia variation (J→1000): Classical controllers fail; RL more robust

Detumbling (ω₀=10 rad/s): Classical fails; RL approaches target asymptotically

Known Limitations:

RL Stochasticity: Results vary across runs due to random seeds and experience replay sampling

Mitigation: Fixed seed (rng(42)) and multiple training runs recommended

DDPG Case 2 divergence: Large angle recovery with stochastic agent and isDone boundary condition

Root cause: Training distribution mismatch; agent leaves exploration space

Scope exclusions: Double DQN, Dueling architecture, Transformers remain out of scope

PID Gains:

Kp = 20;    % Proportional gain

Ki = 0.12;  % Integral gain (steady-state disturbance rejection)

Kd = 39.7;  % Derivative gain (damping)

DDPG Setup:

% Actor/Critic network: 2 hidden layers, 128 neurons

% Replay buffer: 1e6 capacity

% Batch size: 64

% Noise decay: 1e-3

% StopTrainingValue: 400 

% actInfo bounds: [-5, 5] 

DQN Setup:

% Action space: [-1, 0, 1]

% Q-value network: 2 hidden layers, 64 neurons

% Epsilon-greedy: ε=1.0, decay=1e-3, min=0.05

% Domain randomisation: ±10% inertia variation

% Replay buffer: 1e5 capacity, batch size 32
